# Language-Detection-Model
Building a Language Detection model based on a data which has text and the language name using NLP and deeplearning

Using vectorization and sklearn library I have build a basic model with logistic reggression which will detect which language is given as input

Sklearn is very powerfull and very easy to build a model

7 Languages used : ENGLISH, FRENCH, DUTCH, DANISH, SPANISH, ITALIAN, GERMAN

Language Detection.csv is the data 
From that I extracted 7 languages data with labels and cleaned it using regex(Regular expression)
Preprocessing of data is done with the labels and i have given that data into a pipeline 
Pipeline is used for executing operations one after the other so i have given first operation as vectorization 
and second as the model training initialization


Thats it very easy and simple code
Any doubts you can ask me on my git or email!
